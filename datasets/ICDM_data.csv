The question is, is it a Braun or a Keurig?From a looks standpoint, it’s a Braun, albeit a new one. There’s little sense of classicism here, merely an over-caffeinated design that wears its cheap gray plastic cladding reminiscent of a Pontiac Aztek. Couple that with an over-caffeinated headlight design, a large aggressive grille, swoopy side sculpting, bulging wheel arches and the cliched blacked-out rear roof pillars, and you’ll wonder if Homer Simpson - or someone at De’Longhi - designed it.It cloaks a perfectly ingratiating subcompact crossover, one that starts at a reasonable $21,035. Offered in SE and SEL trim with a 147-horsepower 2.0-liter engine mated to a six-speed automatic transmission, it’s also available in plusher Limited, Ultimate and Iron Man trim (the latter being finished in gray and red) starting at $26,595, and fitted with a 174-horsepower 1.6-liter four mated to a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission.",automotiveEngineering
1,"BEACON, N.Y. - I had arrived at the Roundhouse, a former manufacturing facility in Beacon, New York, a small town once known for its hat manufacturing. This facility, like many others in town, had been converted into something else, in this case, a trendy postmodern chic hotel that made me appreciative that I wasn’t staying at some generic chain hotel. My room had large picture windows overlooking picturesque man-made rapids. All was great. I had traveled here to explore the back roads of the Hudson Valley and its many wonderful small towns. I decided to flop onto the bed and finalize where to drive. This is when my love affair of the hotel came to a crashing halt. In an era where people are trading in their sedans for crossovers, mainly due to its elevated seating height and ease of getting in and out, some out-of-touch, brain-dead designer thinks that a bed an inch off the floor is glamorous. It’s not. Instead, it makes you feel like some poverty-stricken slob sleeping on the floor.Nevertheless, once grounded on the mattress, I surveyed where I should drive.I could go to Hyde Park and visit President Roosevelt’s home. Nope. Been there. Then there’s the Vanderbilt Mansion; too bad I’ve toured it already. On and on it went until I realized I had never been to the Culinary Institute of America, where the nation’s finest chefs get trained. A day or two of tackling the twisties capped by a fabulous gourmet meal would be fun - especially since I would be driving the 2019 Chevrolet Blazer.",automotiveEngineering

Crossover SUVs are the reason why. So it goes. In order to make room on dealership lots for the 2020 crossover lineup, Buick is anxious to liquidate what’s left of LaCrosse stock, and that means one major thing: discounts.The premium automaker is offering a new rebate that takes 16% off the LaCrosse’s sticker price. In some situations, that means up to $8,000 off. This new incentive is nationwide and is applicable to most 2019 LaCrosse sedans. What does ""most” mean in this case?

And yet, when their latest concept car rolled onto the stage at the opening party it was clear they’d caught the crowd off guard. They did so in a way automakers rarely do (especially one as hyper-focused on the future as BMW)‚ by digging into an obscure moment from the brand’s past. What started as a personal fascination with a faded photograph for BMW’s senior vice president of design Adrian Von Hooydonk, ended up being an incredible project that recreated a classic concept car: the Garmisch.The first time the Garmisch concept rolled out in front of an audience was at the 1970 Geneva Motor Show. A stunning and unique take on BMW’s “Neue Klasse” design language, by the Turin-based design studio Bertone, the Garmisch had been commissioned by Nuccio Bertone himself. He “wanted to consolidate his existing relationship with BMW by designing a surprise show car for the Geneva Motor Show” says Marcello Gandini, who was head of Bertone’s design department at the time. Gandini (who is highly regarded in the automotive design world for having penned a few legendary cars while at Bertone, such as the Lancia Stratos Zero, Lamborghini Miura and Countach) tells us, “We wanted to create a modern mid-size coupe that was faithful to BMW’s design language, but was more futuristic and even a bit provocative.”",automotiveEngineering

Sure, you also could include the brand's Outback station wagon and subcompact Crosstrek hatchback in the mix. But the Forester and Ascent both are capable enough in many ways to be cross-shopped with each other, depending on what exactly you're looking for. While we've grown to appreciate the overall agreeableness and three rows of seats in our long-term Ascent test vehicle, there's a lot to like about the latest Forester as well.With only two rows of seats versus three in the Ascent, the Forester is 14.7 inches shorter, 4.5 inches narrower, and has 8.7 fewer inches between its axles. Pricing for the Forester starts at $25,270 and can run into the mid-$30,000s, whereas the larger Ascent will set you back at least $32,970 and the top-level Touring model tops $45K. Although the two share a family resemblance, the Ascent's taller beltline and narrower side windows gives it a more traditional SUV-like appearance versus the Forester's tall-station-wagon look.

The TourX makes it easy to load large, bulky items due to its power lift gate and lower ride height than many crossovers, too.",automotiveEngineering

Police investigators are often tasked with hunting for and identifying groups of related crimes — crime patterns. “Investigators have historically built patterns with a process that is manual, time-consuming, memory based, and liable to inefficiency,” Evan Levine, the NYPD’s assistant commissioner of data analytics, and Alex Chohlas-Wood, former director of analytics for the NYPD, say in a February article in INFORMS Journal on Applied Analytics. “To improve this process, we developed a set of three supervised machine-learning models, which we called Patternizr.” 
 Patternizr, which the NYPD first deployed in December 2016, is a “decision support tool and recommendation engine that consists of a set of machine learning models” to make searching for crime patterns more efficient and effective, Levine and Chohlas-Wood note.",publicSecurity

Flashing back to 2015,  drones had shown some progress but were still mired in strict Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) regulations. The use of drones was limited to early  adopters, many of which already had aviation divisions for manned aircraft. In  2016, the most important factor to enhance adoption was on the regulatory side when  the FAA published new rules for both public agency flight (Certificate of  Authorization or COA) and commercial flight (Part 107). Even after these  regulatory changes, drones did not really start expanding throughout public  safety until the catastrophic hurricanes in 2017. In addition to the  hurricanes, other large natural disasters such as floods, tornados, wildland  fires, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions would unequivocally prove the value  of public safety drones.In 2018,  the Bard Center for the Study of the Drone published a report that over 900  public safety agencies in the United States had received an approved COA from  the FAA.

What sets the Skai apart is its power source: Hydrogen fuel cells.“It’s the cleanest form of energy available on the planet,” Alaka’i board member Dr. Bruce Holmes told Digital Trends regarding the choice of hydrogen. Many competitor designs use batteries, but Alaka’i believes it can achieve a lower environmental impact and better performance from fuel cells, Holmes said. Fuel cells have much greater energy density than batteries, he said, meaning they can store more energy in a given volume. That allows for a reduction in weight without sacrificing operating range. The Skai’s fuel cells are also 99% recyclable, don’t use the rare-earth metals found in lithium-ion batteries, and have a decades-long lifespan, Holmes said. Refueling is also quicker than recharging a battery pack, at under 10 minutes.",automotiveEngineering

A new 8.0-inch screen now comes standard and an optional 12.3-inch unit returns.

Opting for the larger touchscreen also adds an enhanced voice command function that recognizes more phrases versus the standard one.Lexus also revised the 2020 RX's suspension with thicker but hollow front and rear stabilizer bars, retuned dampers and shock absorbers, and stiffer anti-roll bars to improve ride comfort. The 2020 Lexus RX also gets a brake-based torque vectoring system the subtly applies the brakes on the inner wheels for better handling and stability through turns.

105,"""Make it more confident and intuitive to drive."" That was the feedback current owners of Ford's wild-child, track-rat, flat-plane-crank, manual-only Mustang Shelby GT350 offered when the development team went asking. Although buyers of the Shelby GT350R tend to be pretty accomplished shoes, buyers of the ""base"" GT350 are more likely to drive their cars daily and take them to a track much less frequently. As such, these owners tend to be less practiced and more fearful of wadding up their babies. The team kept this wish in mind as it pushed the current Mustang platform to new levels of performance while developing the forthcoming GT500, and is now rolling out a new GT500 with higher performance limits that are easier to reach. (The GT350R remains unchanged for 2019.) Assisting with the aforementioned development was veteran race driver Billy Johnson, who's spent three years working with the team while also racing Ford GTs and prepping the Mustang GT4 race car, which he's campaigning this year.",automotiveEngineering

So when I came across the vibrant collection of L’Oreal Paris Infallible Eye Silkissime Eyeliners several years ago, it was definitely love at first sight. (If you are more into the classic brown or black look, fear not because this inexpensive pick also comes in those colors, too.)For years, I’d been using eyeliners from prestige brands simply because the color selection was better, so I was pretty jazzed to find a fun collection of liners at a reasonable price. I don’t generally spend a lot on eye makeup simply because it has such a short shelf life, so I was happy to spend $4 on an eyeliner rather than $20+.I instantly fell for the teal liner from the Silkissime collection and was excited to see that it was just as effective as it was pretty. The silky pencil glides on like a dream, and the smooth consistency doesn’t tug at my eyelid like most sharper pencils do.To be honest, I’m still perfecting my cat eye, so I tend to go for gel and pencil liners — liquid liner is not my friend! — and this creamy pencil definitely makes application a breeze. It gives off an intense pop of color I love, and it’s super easy to get a precise line.The Silkissime eyeliner can stay put for up to 16 hours, so it’s always my go-to whenever I’m heading out to a concert or another event where I know I’ll be out pretty late.

The paraglider had a rainbow colored parachute but he could not see an identifying number. He was concerned that livestock might be spooked or someone might be bucked off a spooked horse. The resident was advised that this is an issue for the Federal Aeronautics Administration and to call while the incident is occurring.WHPS received two reports from residents about being scammed by a solicitor. They thought they were signing up for new TV service with Dish TV. The solicitor had them write a check for the sign up fee to him personally instead of the service provider. Cases are under investigation.Friday, May 31At 2:30 - 5:30 a.m., on the 5000 block of Koch’s Crossing, a residence was burglarized while the homeowners were asleep inside.

But unlike other infamous multitaskers like three-in-one shampoo, body wash, and conditioner hybrids that wind up falling short on all accounts, this isn't a Pyrrhic victory. It has worked well for me in all forms.In terms of cons, the Cleansing Balm is expensive for a skincare product, isn't the most travel-friendly size, and, depending on your skin and makeup routine, probably won't be the one skincare product you need for clear, well-nourished skin.Since it's a balm, I typically use a dual-cleansing routine if I wear makeup to make sure I don't leave any residue behind or impede upon the Balm's ability to nourish my skin directly. If you typically wear thick foundation and plan to only use the Cleansing Balm, you may need to go over it with a wash cloth or cotton pad a couple of times to make sure you're not leaving any residue behind.",cosmetics

Protein treatments are exactly what they sound like: they're deep conditioners that use proteins (among other ingredients) to strengthen your hair, repair damage, and prevent breakage. Hair naturally contains a protein called keratin, which can break down with chemical processing, heat damage, and sun exposure. That's why protein treatments are a crucial part of the process of maintaining healthy, natural hair.

When prepping your skin for a full face of glam, it's essential to start off by applying one of the best moisturizers for under makeup. And like with any other skin-care product, you want to make sure you're using the right formula for your specific skin type.No matter what your primary skin concern is, you'll want to avoid any night creams or rich moisturizers that will be too heavy to sink into the skin, since that can mess with your makeup application.

Though silicones like dimethicone (the most prominent type of silicone in makeup primers) often find themselves on the questionable ingredients list, many makeup artists recommend the ingredient, and dermatologists note that it's hypoallergenic and noncomedogenic.For dry and dehydrated skin types, opt for a lightweight moisturizer that contains multiple hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid or glycerin.

The two council members who voted against it were Tyler Servant and Harold Worley. The main highlights of the budget include a slight tax increase, good pay raises for county staff and bonuses for public safety staff. Under the budget, all county employees would receive a 4.4% pay raise. Public safety employees would receive bonuses based on how long they’ve been working with the county. For example, if a police officer has been with Horry County Police Department for 10 years, they’d receive a $5,000 bonus. Officers with two years of experience would get a $1,000 raise. The budget includes a tax increase in order to pay for public safety improvements, but county leaders said it’s a small enough increase to make it worth it. “The majority of citizens don’t mind paying an extra fee or a small tax increase as long as they are getting a service that they want,” councilman Al Allen said.

The new shaping and contouring is said to be keyed towards Lexus' new design language – but to us, the subtle modifications feel more like comparing dialects rather than two completely different languages.The new headlights also add to Lexus' revised design. Coined as ""triple-beam"" LED headlights, the housings have been made significantly more compact and sporty in order to flow with the ""pinched"" fascia. Changes to the rear of the RX are far less noticeable, though the taillights have changed by flipping the red and clear portions of the housing from top to bottom.The angled reflectors also change position and become more integrated into the bumper's styling and less obtrusive to the overall look of the SUV. Lexus says that it did add an optional kick sensor to open and close the rear hatch, something which brings it in-line with most new SUVs on the market.While the controversial spindle grille is still present on the vehicle, angular changes have made it appear less aggressive to say the least. Some of the harshest lines have been smoothed out and replaced instead by a series of angled shapes to promote a sense of flowing and modernization over its predecessor. ",automotiveEngineering

Real said he agreed with a related ruling from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago that said: “The attorney general in this case used the sword of federal funding to conscript state and local authorities to aid in federal civil immigration enforcement. But the power of the purse rests with Congress, which authorized the federal funds at issue and did not impose any immigration enforcement conditions on the receipt of such funds.” As a sanctuary city, Los Angeles does not provide the cooperation required by the grants.

On his first day, Jones, 32, was offered a sandwich by one of the nurses and asked for a vegan option – he was left nonplussed by the response. “The nurse actually didn’t know what a vegan was, it was shocking really,” he explains. While he says that staff tried to be helpful, all he was offered was a sandwich with lettuce, tomato and cucumber – but the bread was spread with butter, so he couldn’t eat it.",cateringServices

A three-decade veteran of the department, Tim Cox had been serving as interim chief after former Chief Mike Register was promoted to head of public safety last month. Cox was officially hired to the position at a salary of $138,000 by a vote of 4-1 with south Cobb Commissioner Lisa Cupid objecting. Cupid said her concerns were with the process, not the candidate, suggesting the board rushed to hire Cox without giving fair consideration to other candidates. Cox won the support of the other commissioners and Ben Williams, the head of the Cobb chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, who has been critical of the police department in the past. “In the last couple of years, I think it’s fair to say I’ve seen a number of excellent changes in the culture of our police department,” Williams said. “Deputy Chief Cox is someone who I believe is the right person at this time in order to provide the continuity for the changes that are taking place in our district.”",publicSecurity

243,"In theory, this could result in a combined output upwards of 640 hp (477 kW), though we suspect range would take quite a hit. An increase to 500 hp (373 kW) or possibly 550 hp (410 kW) seems more realistic, especially since the e-tron already has some eyebrows raised with its current range of just over 200 miles. Initial reports had Audi’s electric SUV going over 250 miles on a charge but the automaker later dialed that estimate back quite a bit. Presumably, the S model would offer a larger battery pack to offset the added thrust without further reductions in range, but a larger pack would also equate to more weight.On the exterior side, we can see Audi would fit the e-tron with a snazzier grille and lower fascia to inject a bit more attitude into the people mover.

245,"In this in-depth report, Nation's Restaurant News looks at the changing workforce and how restaurants can keep up. Five years ago, the proposal for a $15 per hour minimum wage seemed a ridiculous suggestion coming from radical fringe groups. That dramatic an increase would require massive menu price hikes, opponents argued. It would kill jobs and kill businesses. Today, it seems restaurant operators are increasingly seeing $15 an hour as inevitable at a time when attracting and keeping good workers is harder than ever. The new reality for restaurants is that labor has become more expensive. Sure, menu prices are going up, and restaurant unit growth has slowed somewhat — which some see as a good thing, given the overpopulation of restaurants in some markets. But restaurants are not dying. They are adapting by changing the way they think about attracting and retaining workers. Perhaps the forces behind the “Fight for $15” movement can take some credit, spurring the ongoing debate around what constitutes a living wage.",cateringServices

272,"To say we’re not fans of the BMW M2 Competition would be completely dishonest. We love that coupe and it is, perhaps, the best car in the German automaker’s current lineup. But, like any new BMW, the M2 Competition isn't cheap. In fact, thanks to a member of the Bimmerpost forum, the powerful coupe can get ridiculously expensive. The M2 Competition carries an MSRP of $58,900 and it serves as a replacement for the standard M2 coupe. The biggest change was the replacement of the turbocharged engine with a new single scroll twin-turbo unit that utilizes the same carbon fiber strut as used in the M4.Power has also been increased to 405 hp and 406 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed manual comes standard while the 7-speed dual-clutch is optional. Honestly, $60k isn’t terrible for that package. However, that forum member discovered one specific new option that’ll immediately jack up the final price to nearly $84,000. That’s right. One option. What is it? An additional power upgrade? An all carbon fiber body? No and no. The answer is San Marino Blue Metallic paint. That’s right. Blue exterior paint for an additional $24,480. Who will pay for this?",automotiveEngineering
273,"The Audi E-tron GT concept car that debuted at last year's LA Auto Show had a low-slung, sexy look. It's no surprise, then, that the production car will look nearly identical to the concept car.Patent sketches surfaced of the model via the E-tron Forum, Jalopnik reported on Tuesday. The sketches come from the Chinese State Intellectual Property Office and they nearly mirror the concept vehicle Audi showed  in LA. The car in the drawings has the same squinty headlights, a similar grille shape (which Audi calls a ""sensor array"" since a grille isn't needed for an electric car""), and the same taillights that span the width of the car. The patent sketches didn't even bother to swap in a different wheel design.None of this is shocking. Audi design boss Mark Lichte told Motor Authority at the E-tron GT concept's debut that the concept already featured a sheet metal body. Translation: the car was really close to production-ready at its debut. Audi is already building pre-production prototypes for the electric grand tourer.",automotiveEngineering

It’s not quite as big or dramatic as the S-Class, opting instead for subtlety – but not subtlety without beauty. The lines flow cleanly from front to rear. This is most readily seen in profile, where the unique shape, long hood and short rear decklid can all be seen at the same time. Up front, the grille is the highlight, with attractive detailing featuring small “pellets” that radiate out from the large Mercedes logo in the middle.Inside, the cabin is similar in styling, with a curved dashboard that wraps around front occupants.

Most of the praise went to the massive, 5.2-liter V-8 that’s special to the GT350 and its more-aggressive sibling, the GT350R. Unlike the GT350R, though, the standard-issue Shelby gets some notable upgrades for 2019.First off, Ford worked with Michelin to design a new set of high-performance tires. When you’re sending 526 horsepower to the rear wheels, bad tires can limit the speed. They’re crucial to the success of any performance car, especially considering that they can improve handling, acceleration and braking.Next up, Ford re-tuned the suspension and magnetic dampers. Magnetic dampers allow the GT350 to stiffen the suspension for better performance on the track but soften up to handle potholes and bumps for street driving.",automotiveEngineering

286,"Pretrial detention, or keeping a person who has been accused of a crime in jail until their trial, is a common practice. It’s been touted as a way to both ensure public safety and get people to appear in court. But a growing body of research suggests that its effectiveness has been overstated — and that this practice is causing serious harm to the hundreds of thousands of unconvicted people pushed into jails largely because they can’t afford to pay the bail money required to remain free. A new report on pretrial detention released by the Vera Institute of Justice shows that this type of detention has an especially severe effect on marginalized communities — like poor people, women, and black and Latino people. “People who cannot afford to post bail—in particular, people from poor communities—remain in jail, often until their cases are resolved, while those who have access to financial resources are able to secure their liberty,” the authors of the report point out. This isn’t just a temporary hardship, either. According to the Vera Institute, people detained for longer periods are more likely to be convicted and receive harsher sentences than people who pay the required bail fees and are released or are never required to pay bail in the first place.",publicSecurity
